1. fileNames -> names of articles
2. articles  -> list of (list of entities of those articles)
3. tweetList -> list of tweets we get finally


note:
1. you may have to normalize the number of tweets ( maybe just add 1 if some article gets 0 tweets). 
2. when finding score of an entity, divide by total number of classified tweets ( many tweets will be neither +ve nor -ve). you will  have to check for division by 0 also.
3. While final scoring, do divide the number of tweets of each article by the numner of entities of that article, coz some articles may have large/small number of entities.
4. config file has all inputs
5. I think multiwords are also works, but not accurate( you can check variable 'filterStr')
